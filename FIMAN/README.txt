1.Introduction
===========================================================================
This package implements a novel multi-view partial multi-label algorithm named FIMAN. 
Technical details of this algorithm can be found in the following paper:

[1] Jing-Han Wu, Xuan Wu, Qing-Guo Chen, Yao Hu, Min-Ling Zhang. Feature-Induced Manifold Disambiguation for Multi-View Partial Multi-label Learning. (KDD'20), San Diego, California USA, 2020, in press.

2. Requirements
===========================================================================
- Matlab, version 2015b and higher.

3. Installation
===========================================================================
- Create a directory of your choice.
- Set the path in your Matlab to add the directory you just created.

4. How to start?
===========================================================================
To help you start working with FIMAN, we provide a demo(See demo.m) in this package. 
You can follow the procedure as described in the demo.

Please read and play with the demo to get started. Have fun!
